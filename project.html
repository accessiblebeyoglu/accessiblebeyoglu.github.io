                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Accessibility is as problematic as discrimination and it has earned a rightful place among the projects
of international organizations. Accessibility which means access to the social and cultural
environment as well as the natural environment and also, utilization of the services plays an important
role in the use of every right. Public, even individual living spaces are designed for the majority of the
society because of this, disabled citizens often cannot exercise their right of access. Most of the
world public buildings and transportation infrastructure are not suitable for disabled citizens to
access. Because of the unsuitable transportation vehicles and systems many disabled citizens don't
search for jobs or go to the hospitals. <br><br>The Council of Europe’s Disability Action Plan 2006 - 2015 is
"Improving the quality of life of people with disabilities in Europe" is a resolution that drives the fight
against discrimination, opportunity inequality and it aims to support the full participation of the
disabled citizens in the political processes by European Council ministerial committee.
<br><br>The Project " Accessible Beyoğlu" will be carried out in June 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018 Activities of
the project will take place between December 30, 2018 and January 6, 2019 with 44 youth.
Participants who are from 7 different countries (Algeria, Bulgaria, Germany, Palestine, Italy Ukraine
and Turkey) are going to attend our youth exchange in Istanbul, Turkey. <br><br>The overall aim of the
project is to contribute social inclusion of people with disabilities through accessibility and raise
awareness of accessibility for people who have disability at the national and international level.
The specific objectives of this youth exchange include to create an Accessible Beyoğlu Map which
shows accessible locations such as hospitals, schools, public transport, sport centers and
restaurants using open source software, to increase the social accessibility and mobility of the
citizens with disabilities, to encourage young people to volunteer for people who have disabilities and
to increase awareness of disability rights between youth and local communities.
During project, participants will have workshop with non formal education methods about
accessibility of people who have disability. The methods will be team building, group dynamics,
debates, outdoor activities, visits, role plays, challenges and fair etc. The main activities are creating
accessible map, Feel an empathy with disabled people: All of Us are Disabled, Visiting Rehabilitation
Center for Person with Disabilities, No Borders Flashmob, Coffee Talks " disabled role model and
design a sticker for Disability Friendly places. Created accessible map will be published on internet
with user also prepared report will be sent to related are of government and municipality.
The project aims to advance participants’ awareness of disability rights, understanding of being a
volunteer, information about software technologies and ICT and basic information about mapping
and understanding of mapping as solution tool for social responsibility projects
The project is going to take place in Istanbul which has not any movement about accessibility of
person who have disability. Participants; improvement of young people -chosen among people who
have disability and NEETS (“Not in Education, Employment, or Training") and vulnerable youth, who
face physical, social, economic or geographical challenges, will be included in the youth exchange.
<br><br>”Accessible Beyoğlu” will be to contribute to the local community in Istanbul by promoting the first
accessible map in the city. Once the participants complete the youth exchange and return to their
local communities, they are likely to promote this volunteering project to create accessible map.This
map may contribute to increase inclusion and employability of people who have disability. Since the
youth exchange will equip participants with practical tools and to create similar maps in their
communities, so they will be able to disseminate the desired impact of the project among their local</p>
